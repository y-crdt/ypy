# Ypy

Ypy is a Python binding for Y-CRDT. It provides distributed data types that enable real-time collaboration between devices. Ypy can sync data with any other platform that has a Y-CRDT binding, allowing for seamless cross-domain communication. The library is a thin wrapper around Yrs, taking advantage of the safety and performance of Rust.

> ðŸ§ª Project is still experimental. Expect the API to change before a version 1.0 stable release.

## Installation

```
pip install y-py
```

## Getting Started

Ypy provides many of the same shared data types as [Yjs](https://docs.yjs.dev/). All objects are shared within a `YDoc` and get modified within a transaction block.

```python
import y_py as Y

d1 = Y.YDoc()
# Create a new YText object in the YDoc
text = d1.get_text('test')
# Start a transaction in order to update the text
with d1.begin_transaction() as txn:
    # Add text contents
    text.extend(txn, "hello world!")

# Create another document
d2 = Y.YDoc()
# Share state with the original document
state_vector = Y.encode_state_vector(d2)
diff = Y.encode_state_as_update(d1, state_vector)
Y.apply_update(d2, diff)

value = str(d2.get_text('test'))

assert value == "hello world!"
```

## Development Setup

0. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (consider [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))
1. [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) 
 - [Optional] Configure Poetry to create `.venv` folders in current directory when running `poetry install`: `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`
2. Install the `y-py` dependencies into the virtual environment and build a wheel for `y-py` using `maturin`

*All `poetry run` commands below can be replaced by entering into `poetry shell` first if you prefer*
```
poetry install
poetry run maturin develop
```

## Tests

All tests are located in `/tests`. You can run them with:

```
poetry run pytest
```

## Build Ypy :

Build the library as a wheel and store them in `target/wheels`:

```
poetry run maturin build
```
